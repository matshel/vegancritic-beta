# Project exam 1 - Vegancritic

## About the project

This is my delivery for the exam for the first year studying front end development at Noroff.

The project is a personal blog by "Eva Normann" called Vegancritic.
The purpose of this blog is critiquing vegan dishes served at restaurants around the world, and writing blog post about it!

The backend is a headless Wordpress install, hosted on a Hostinger server. The data is fetched through a REST API endpoint.
